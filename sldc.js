/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisofRequirements = " the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product"
const design = "The Design phase models the way a software application will work"
const implementation = "Implementation includes, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production computers."
